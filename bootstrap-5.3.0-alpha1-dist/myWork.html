            <p>When people think of work in Soshanguve they think of a street vendor, well even though is a common for other for a mere fact it generates a lot of cash and contributes a lot to the economy. Well me being me chose a different approach to life,
                with rising tech demands and people buying tech/devices that they don't know or understand, I up with idea to capitalize on my vast knowledge on these devices and chose to fix them for a living.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well as others speculated business was very slow and people didn't trust me thinking that I am a creepy guy lurking in the shadows with rusted screw-driver waiting to harvest their kidneys, well they were wrong and wasted money going to other people because
                I charged close to nothing. I was happy with my business because those who came when with a smile on their faces, that made me very happy indeed to learn that I am skilled in my computer.

                Then 2019 came where came with its diseases that forced the military out of years of immense anger and brutal lust for war and our president launched that all on the people dictatorship? That not the point is covid came as a pinch in everyone's pockets
                and It was a thread to businesses not just mine. Fast forward everything was funny and I could feel it on my diaphragm and everyone was poor all in one year. I had no choice but forced myself to work harder than all the PC doctors that
                magically appeared in 2020.

            <p>
                With all the pressure on me I had to find a way that could make people understand that I understand, I came with a genius un original plan that requires me blackmail every customer to be leave an "honest review", that helped me a lot and left everyone
                in the dust and me a family regular.
